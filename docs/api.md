Sometimes Bot Frameworks can't fit with a developer or a project.

Then you can build your own middleware via API's. We are also offering developers to build their own middleware with our powerful Platform API.

This API will help you to manage your additional data, events or other things you can do with your bot.

Right now, {mono}say offers you lots of API endpoints. We are building more to integrate your process successfully. Help us to help you more.
